# Week 1
## Weekly Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Plans to achieve
1. Attend TDD Workshop: The TDD Process, Read Intro to TDD Resources, work through TDD exercise 'Design Strategies'
2. Pair program every afternoon on the Boris Bike challenge.
3. Follow and effective debugging process: attend Debugging workshop.
4. Read Object Oriented resources, and work through OOD Encapsulation and Cohesion exercises

### Evidence:
1.

* Wrote up learning from TDD Process Workshop
* The Four Phases of a Test
* Three Rules of TDD
* Completed [Design_Strategies_1 Exercises](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/design_strategies_1)
* Accidental attendance at Process Workshop completing [Leap Years](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/leap_years), with video recording [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sXwftUTiVFtdCwSNphrY9j4fTtPVTzNu/view?usp=sharing), and feedback provided by course coach.

2.

* Worked through to step 15 on the [Boris Bike Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/boris-bike-3) Worked with 4 different pairing partners over 4 days.
* Sought feedback through a google form. [Results Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tekoYukeMELTtP4mBrUuBe1rnsvwyWjXgXuRCTW567M/edit#gid=1968678069)

3.

* Wrote up learning from Debugging Workshop

4.

* Wrote up learning from Encapsulation reading
* Worked through [OOC, Encapsulation and Cohesion Exercises](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/OOD_Encapsulation_and_Cohesion)

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

* Not quite. I have started progress on all the objectives. But Only feel I can demonstrate strong evidence for pair programming.
* Conceptually I feel TDD is good, but still being hampered by Rspec syntax understanding.
* I feel pretty comfortable with debugging from prior experience, but have very weak evidence to demonstrate ability so far at Makers - perhaps should have spend a bit more time on this and less on TDD.
* For OOD I feel I have made sufficient progress and for week 1.

### What would you improve going forward?

* Plan out the full week's learning objectives a bit more thoroughly at the beginning of the week rather than just rolling from day to day.
* Really think a bit more about how to build up a strong evidence base by the end of the week.
* Spend less time on reading materials and more time on doing exercises/challenges
* Perhaps get a bit more efficient setting and reflecting on daily learning.
