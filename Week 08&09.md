## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. High. Enjoyed working in a team. on the Acebook challenge. We dissected the problem well, and adapted to changing client requirements well. Two day sprint cycles worked well, with estimation, sprint planning and retros. And daily stand ups and reviews.
2. High. Instagram challenge went well, after an initially painful set up process. Was pleased with the styling of my finished project.


### What would you improve going forward?

* I think I would be more patient/conscientious when picking up a new framework, to make sure I go through the walkthroughs thoroughly before diving into implementation.
