# Week 10
## Weekly Goals

* Can you solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code?
    - By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change.
* Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
* Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.

### Plans to achieve
1. Complete Bank Tech Test
2. Complete Gilded Rose Tech Test
3. Complete Chitter Frontend Challenge

### Evidence:
1. **Complete Bank Tech Test:**

* Completed a bank tech test, with high code quality, utilising TDD and OO design skills in Ruby [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/bank_tech_test)
* With trello write up [Bank Tech Test](https://trello.com/c/Sl9SkaWH)

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. High. Yes, I feel I met the first objective well, in completing Bank Tech Test and Gilded Rose Tech test. Both were were reviewed with minor comments for further improvement.
2. High. Yes, feel confident in my ability to complete a tech test.
3. Medium. Definitely improving on TDD, and OO but more work required. Particularly around SOLID principles.


### What would you improve going forward?

* Further understand, and implement SOLID principles.
