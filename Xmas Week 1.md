# Week 4
## Weekly Goals
Reinforce Learning by revisiting Week 1 and Week 2 Challenges.

### Plans to achieve

1. Re-do Boris Bike Challenge
2. Complete Oystercard Challenge

### Evidence:
1. **Re-do Boris Bike Challenge:**

* Re-did the Boris Bike challenge; establishing a dev environment with CI (Travis) integration. BDDing an OOD, with diagramming of domain model for each user story. Worked through adding Vans and Garages, and modelling these and Docking Stations using a 'Bike Container' module as a 'mixin'.

2. **Complete Oystercard Challenge**

* Not completed.

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. High. Was good to go back an re-complete. Definitely reinforce previous learning, and extending understanding of BDD (with the interplay between User Story->Feature Test->Unit Test->Refactor).
2. Low. I didn't complete. But can do next week.


### What would you improve going forward?

* Give myself another half day to complete week 2 as well.
