# Week 4
## Weekly Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:

1. Build a simple web app with a database
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)


### Plans to achieve
1. Complete Bookmark Manager Challenge, Chitter Challenge, and Daily Diary App
2. Ensure effective 'Close the loop, get visibility' of the above.
3. Complete; Database Domain Modelling Workshop, Entity Relationship Diagrams Practical, SQL Zoo Practical, SQL Murder Mystery Practical.

### Evidence:
1. **Build a simple web app with a database:**

* Worked through establishing a web app development environment in combination with a database in PostgreSQL, then used TDD to work towards a simple MVC pattern, with persistence [Bookmark Manager Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/bookmark_manager)
* Trello Write Up: [Bookmark Manager](https://trello.com/c/HG3xkWxN)
* **Unguided** Worked through establishing a web app development environment in combination with a database in PostgreSQL, then used TDD to work towards a simple MVC pattern, with persistence [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/chitter-challenge)
* Trello Write Up: [Chitter](https://trello.com/c/L6jol7O5)

2. **Follow an effective debugging process for database applications**

* Completed **Above challenges with working databases**
* Trello Write Up: [Effective Debugging Process for Database Applications](https://trello.com/c/26FV9zwf)

3. **Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)**

* Complete workshop. Trello Write up: [Database Domain Model Diagramming Workshop]([Database Domain Model Diagramming Workshop]) Learning about CRC cards.
* Completed [SQL Murder Mystery](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/sql_murder_mystery/tree/main); Who dunnit?! Fun game to get comfortabe with querying database tables, and linking data.
* Trello Write Up: [Basics of How Databases Work](https://trello.com/c/OTOcr1mg). Basics of tables, and entity relationships (One to One, One to Many, Many to Many) and how to manage with joining tables.

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. High. With Bookmark Manager, Daily Diary App, and Chitter. I feel confident to say I can build a simple web app, with a database application for persisting data.
2. Medium. I didn't specifically do any exercises to demonstrate this. But feel that through setting up the databases on the challenges, and getting these working, I can do debug a database to an extent.
3. Medium. Can demonstrate some ability with SQL databases, but based on prior experience, I know there is more to demonstrate (e.g joins, functions, stored procedures etc)

### What would you improve going forward?

* Need to get better at planning, breaking the problem down into smaller steps, and testing accordingly.
* Pushed harder on the challenges this week. Trying to get further along. Felt this helped, with getting to a full handle on CRUD.
* The SQL Murder Mystery was fun, but not sure how much I learnt. Perhaps I could use my self guided study time a bit more effectively.
