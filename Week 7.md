## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. High. Did this twice with the notes app and the news summary app. Definitely got more confident the second time around. Particularly handling async and interfacing with the DOM.
2. High. Enjoyed working with APIs. The guardian API is pretty awesome. Was god to read through the documentation, and user JSON readers to understand the output.


### What would you improve going forward?

* More around group working. In our notes app team, we spent the whole week mobbing. Whilst this may have been good for our learning, it felt a bit hard work. Perhaps in hindsight we should have tried a bit harder to split the work up.
