# Week 5
## Weekly Goals
By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review

### Plans to achieve
1. Complete MakersBnB challenge
2. Complete Bowling Challenge

### Evidence:
1. **Complete MakersBnB Challenge:**

* Working a team, established a web app development environment in combination with a database in PostgreSQL, then used TDD to work towards a simple MVC pattern, with persistence [MakersBnB Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/MakersBnB)

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. Medium. Put lots of energy and time into the MakersBnB challenge. Learnt a lot around teamwork, co-ordinating workflows, git workflows, breaking down specifications into user stories. However, think there is room for improvement. How to get more out of the whole team. Getting everyone to contribute.
2. Medium. Got a working codebase, and refactored reasonably well. Could spend more time on it to improve.

### What would you improve going forward?

* Need to consider how to best give of myself to a team. How do I offer my best contribution, but also foster an environment where others can also offer their best contribution? Need to consider my impact in a team environment.
