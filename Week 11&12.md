## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. High. Yes, from a team perspective we set ourselves the overarching goal to "build an application we will *all* be confident, and proud to talk to to at an interview". And as we maintained consistent rotations, and knowledge sharing, I believe we achieved this. From a personal perspective, I learnt more again, about development work in javascript, and associated test frameworks, plus further developed my team working capabilities.

### What would you improve going forward?

* Perhaps in hindsight we could have been bolder, and built a mobile application in react native. Also, whilst pairing, I need to get better at listening to my pair partner.
