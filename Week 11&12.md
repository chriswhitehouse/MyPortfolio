# Week 11&12
## Weekly Goals

* Can you use high-quality processes to build an extended project in a team?

### Plans to achieve
1. Complete Final Project: Book Me Up

### Evidence:
1. **Complete Final Project: Book Me Up:**

* Built an extended web application as part of a team, utilising Agile development methodologies, git workflows, and test driven development [Book Me Up Project](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/book_swap)
* Maintained a write up of learnings as we progressed [Book Me Up Wiki](https://github.com/argy-bargy/book_swap/wiki)
* And final presentation [Book Me Up Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_rAmHSnp5hEnBioeHbpBwZl0K6ntWStQ0jsH0g1YzzQ/edit#slide=id.gc084b17c7b_0_5)

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. High. Yes, from a team perspective we set ourselves the overarching goal to "build an application we will *all* be confident, and proud to talk to to at an interview". And as we maintained consistent rotations, and knowledge sharing, I believe we achieved this. From a personal perspective, I learnt more again, about development work in javascript, and associated test frameworks, plus further developed my team working capabilities.

### What would you improve going forward?

* Perhaps in hindsight we could have been bolder, and built a mobile application in react native. Also, whilst pairing, I need to get better at listening to my pair partner.
