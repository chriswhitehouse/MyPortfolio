# Week 2
## Weekly Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:

1.  Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2.  Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3.  Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4.  Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. * ease of change)
5.  Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### Plans to achieve
1. Recap Week 1 Skills in Oystercard challenge
2. Complete Domain Modelling Workshop the Secret Diary Practicals + Oystercard challenge
3. Complete OO Testing with Mocking Practical and Dependency Injection Practical
4. Complete OOP3: Delegate, Delegate, Delegate Practical + Making Code Simpler Through Polymorphism Practical
5. Review Airport Weekend Challenge

### Evidence:
1. **Use all of week 1's skills:**

* Continued to Work on TDD, Pairing, Debugging and OOD Principles in the [Oystercard Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/oystercard_2)
* Plus, TDD and Pairing in the Process Workshop [Leap Years 2](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/leap_years_2/tree/main)
* Trello Write Up: [Recap Week 1 Skills](https://trello.com/c/auVSmFaN)

2. **Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage**

* [Domain Modelling Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozpPvV5ghhOI1d6RmTkXuvv1hV---4MXQD6V55nqLdA/edit); splitting user stories into classes, properties and methods
* Completed [Secret Diary Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/OOD_Encapsulation_and_Cohesion/tree/main); splitting out classes.
* Trello Write Up: [Splitting Classes](https://trello.com/c/1SrhXJSc)

3. **Unit test classes in isolation using mocking**

* Completed [OO Testing with Mocking Practical](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/testing_relationships_between_classes/tree/main). Learning how to use doubles to 'mock' the behaviour of a class.
* Completed [Dependency Injection Practical](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/dependency_injection/tree/main); learning how to set up a 'soft dependency' within and class, and pass doubles through to the class for testing.
* Trello Write Up: [Mocking](https://trello.com/c/pSXu0TWe)

4. **Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. * ease of change)**

* Completed [OOP_3: Delegate, Delegate, Delegate](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/oop_3/tree/main); refactoring a 'terrible' todo list code base, into a 'great' code base with separate classes.
* Trello Write Up: [OO Principles](https://trello.com/c/87dDdAge)

5.  **Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback**``

* Attended Code Review Workshop
* Offered my code for review, and reviewed a peers code.
* Trello Write Up: [Code Review](https://trello.com/c/Sk8iThix)

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

* Close. I would say I did well at Mocking, and recapping Week 1 learnings. And the Oystercard challenge generally went well with TDD, Pairing, Debugging, OO and splitting classes.
* Ideally I would have had chance to do a better code review at the beginning of the week. But will get to revisit this after every weekend challenge, so plenty of chance to practice.
* Perhaps didn't quite pick the right practical for working on OO Principles. Perhaps should have picked one of the harder practicals e.g. polymorphism.
* Splitting classes is still tough, but getting better with structured planning, TDD development of new class, and use of mocking to manage the  dependencies.

### What would you improve going forward?

* It wasn't until the end of the week that I managed to start using mocking in the Oystercard challenge. There might be something about trying to better link the weekly challenge and the Practicals i'm doing.
* i've been getting good scores in my pairing [feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tekoYukeMELTtP4mBrUuBe1rnsvwyWjXgXuRCTW567M/edit?usp=sharing), but perhaps need to push for more constructive feedback.
* Similarly, getting good feedback from coaches, on practical code reviews. Perhaps could try to use coaches more to seek areas for improvement and appropriate practicals to do.
