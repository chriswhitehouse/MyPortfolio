## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. High. Was good to go back an re-complete. Definitely reinforce previous learning, and extending understanding of BDD (with the interplay between User Story->Feature Test->Unit Test->Refactor). And developing understanding of object interplay.
2. High. Worked through the to completion well.
3. Medium. Had a lot of ground to cover, so leaned on the walkthroughs heavily. Still good to be introduced to the concepts and best practice solution patterns.
4. High. Feel like solved the challenge well. And pleasing to add a bit of nice CSS.

### What would you improve going forward?

* Possibly pushed too hard, so was tired at the end of the week. Again, maybe another day to work through would have helped.
