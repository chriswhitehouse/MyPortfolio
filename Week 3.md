# Week 3
## Weekly Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:

1. Build a simple web app
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP,  HTML, CSS)
4. Explain the MVC pattern

### Plans to achieve
1. Complete Battle Challenge, complete RPS Challenge
2. Complete Debugging 2 Workshop
3. Complete; HTTP Request/Response Workshop, Servers Practical, Client Practical, HTTP Servers Practical, Birthday Greeter App.
4. Complete Battle Challenge, complete RPS Challenge.

### Evidence:
1. **Build a simple web app:**

* Worked through establishing a web app development environment with Sinatra and Capybara, and then used TDD to work towards a simple MVC pattern [Battle Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/Battle)
* Trello Write Up of Battle Challenge: [Battle](https://trello.com/c/bZriQ912)

2. **Follow an effective debugging process for web applications**

* Completed **Debugging Web Applications Workshop**
* Trello Write Up: [Debugging Web Applications Workshop](https://trello.com/c/kI61fqPM)

3. **Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP,  HTML, CSS)**

* Completed [Servers Practical](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/servers_1/tree/main). Learning about simple server behaviour.
* Completed [Clients Practical](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/clients_1/tree/main); learning how to get the server and client talking to each other over a 'socket'. Simple talking clock app.
* Completed [HTTP Servers Practical](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/http_servers/tree/main). Sets up a server able to respond to an HTTP request with simple HTML.
* Completed [Birthday Greeter App](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/birthday_greeter).  A first unguided web application set up and build.
* Trello Write Up: [How the Web Works](https://trello.com/c/YML20Mqm).

4.  **Explain the MVC pattern**

* Worked through establishing a web app development environment with Sinatra and Capybara, and then used TDD to work towards a simple MVC pattern [Battle Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/Battle)
* Trello Write Up of Battle Challenge: [Battle](https://trello.com/c/bZriQ912)

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. Yes. With Battle, Birthday Greeter, and RPS. I feel confident to say I can build a simple web app.
2. Medium. I still feel confident in my ability to debug problems. But need to be able to verbalise my approach, to work better with pair partners, and to be more structured.
3. Yes. This was my primary focus for practicals. I feel I have a good conceptual understanding of servers, clients, and request/response cycles.
4. Medium. Understand conceptually and have worked through on example in Battle. More work required here.

### What would you improve going forward?

* Need to work on verbalising my debugging process.
* Perhaps need to get better at not being so directive/prescriptive in navigating.
* Felt I was a bit on the back foot a little by the end of the week. Maybe need to push on a little bit.
