# Week 6
## Weekly Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:

* Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language

### Plans to achieve
1. Complete Thermostat challenge
2. FizzBuzz and Airport Rebuilds in JS
3. JS Practicals
4. Complete Bowling Challenge JS

### Evidence:
1. **Complete Thermostat Challenge:**

* Built a simple client side thermostat application in JavaScript [Thermostat Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/thermostat)
* Trello Write Up [Thermostat](https://trello.com/c/MIRUb0l4)

2. **FizzBuzz and Airport Rebuilds in JS**

* A rebuild of the popular FizzBuzz game logic in JavaScript [FizzBuzz JS](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/fizz_buzz_js)
* A rebuild of the airport simulation logic in JavaScript [Airport Challenge JS](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/airport_challenge_js)

3. **JS Practicals**

* [Learning a new language by translation Practical](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/learning_a_new_language_by_translation/tree/main/Projects/learning_a_new_language_by_translation) and trello write up: [Start Learning JS](https://trello.com/c/R3sQV1km)
* [Finding the flow Practical](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/following_the_flow_and_getting_visibility_in_javascript_es6) and trello write up [Debugging in JS](https://trello.com/c/LtNw9eqN)
* [Callbacks and Follow The Flow of Control Practical](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/callbacks_following_the_flow_of_control) and trello write up: [Callbacks](https://trello.com/c/qwKWAUzw)
* [JS Closures](https://hackmd.io/cIFsMAqISHqVHN_-p9hY0Q) and trello write up: [Closures in JS](https://trello.com/c/FC5kp9PE)
* [Asynchroncity and Event Loop](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/skills-workshops/blob/master/week-5/async_JS.md) and trello write up: [Asynchroncity and the event loop](https://trello.com/c/ZCn4RJ6T)
* [Encapsulation with the constructor and prototype](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/encapsulation_with_constructor_and_prototype_pattern)

4. **Complete Bowling Challenge JS**

* Rebuild of a bowling game score logic in JavaScript: [Bowling Challenge JS](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/bowling-challenge/tree/master)
* Trello Write Up [Bowling](https://trello.com/c/CUaaRHa9)

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

1. Medium. Built the Thermostat Challenge out that looked good, had jQuery and AJAX requests. But most of the other challenges just completed the business logic. Would like a bit more time to work on front end a little.
2. High. Doing JS did throw me for the first few days, but I have slowly got into it and feel relatively confident building business logic in JS. Still need to work on some of the extensions. Understand a standard approach to learning a language.


### What would you improve going forward?

* Perhaps just be a bit more patient with myself. New code will sink in after a few days. So just stick with it.
