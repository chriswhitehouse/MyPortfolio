**Three Rules of TDD:**

1) You are not allowed to write production code unless it is to make a failing test pass.
2) You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and compilation failures are failures.
3) You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing test.

The time between running tests should be measured in seconds or minutes. 10 minutes is too long.

Test Driven Development ensures the code is working up to the existing specification almost all the time, or is only ever a minute away from working. No more debugging!

Testing Driven Development forces decoupling of code.
