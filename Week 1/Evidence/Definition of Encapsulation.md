### [Definition of Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29)

* **OOD**: Paradigm of objects that contain data and code. Data in the form of fields (attributes properties), code in the form of procedures (methods). As compared to Imperative Procedural Programs.

* **Classes**: classes are a typical way of enabling encapsulation. Each object is an instance of a class.

* **Encapsulation:** encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class preventing unauthorised parties direct access to them.

* **Publicly Accessible Methods:** are generally provided in the class (so called 'getters' and 'setters') to access the values, and other client classes call these methods to retrieve and modify values within each object.

* **Ruby and Encapsulation:** Ruby is somewhat unusual in that it only allows access via object methods (i.e. everything is private, ensuring encapsulation by default). In contrast, some other software languages offer flexibility e.g. C# or Java with public and private methods.

* **Other info:** OOD bible is called [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) published in 1994.
