# Week 1
## Weekly Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Plans to achieve
1. Attend TDD Workshop: The TDD Process, Read Intro to TDD Resources, work through TDD exercise 'Design Strategies'
2. Pair program every afternoon on the Boris Bike challenge.
3. Attend Debugging workshop.
4. Read Object Oriented resources, and work through OOD Encapsulation and Cohesion exercises

### Evidence:
1.

* Wrote up learning from [TDD Process Workshop](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/MyPortfolio/blob/main/Week%201/TDD%20Process.md)
* [The Four Phases of a Test](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/MyPortfolio/blob/main/Week%201/The%20Four%20Phases%20of%20a%20Test.md)
* [Three Rules of TDD](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/MyPortfolio/blob/main/Week%201/Three%20Rules%20of%20TDD.md)
* Completed [Design_Strategies_1 Exercises](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/design_strategies_1)
* Accidental attendance at Process Workshop completing [Leap Years](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/leap_years), with video recording [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sXwftUTiVFtdCwSNphrY9j4fTtPVTzNu/view?usp=sharing), and feedback provided by course coach.
* Completed [Airport Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge)

2.

* Worked through to step 15 on the [Boris Bike Challenge](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/boris-bike-3) Worked with 4 different pairing partners over 4 days.
* Sought feedback through a google form. [Results Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tekoYukeMELTtP4mBrUuBe1rnsvwyWjXgXuRCTW567M/edit#gid=1968678069)

3.

* [Wrote up learning from Debugging Workshop](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/MyPortfolio/blob/main/Week%201/Debugging%201.md)

4.

* Wrote up learning from [Encapsulation reading](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/MyPortfolio/blob/main/Week%201/Definition%20of%20Encapsulation.md)
* Worked through [OOC, Encapsulation and Cohesion Exercises](https://github.com/chriswhitehouse/OOD_Encapsulation_and_Cohesion)

## Reflection

### Q1: Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?

* Not quite. I have started progress on all the objectives. But Only feel I can demonstrate strong evidence for pair programming.
* Conceptually I feel TDD is good, but still being hampered by Rspec syntax understanding.
* I feel pretty comfortable with debugging from prior experience, but have very weak evidence to demonstrate ability so far at Makers - perhaps should have spend a bit more time on this and less on TDD.
* For OOD I feel I have made sufficient progress and for week 1.

### What would you improve going forward?

* Plan out the full week's learning objectives a bit more thoroughly at the beginning of the week rather than just rolling from day to day.
* Really think a bit more about how to build up a strong evidence base by the end of the week.
* Spend less time on reading materials and more time on doing exercises/challenges
* Perhaps get a bit more efficient setting and reflecting on daily learning.
