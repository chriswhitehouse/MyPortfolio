**The Four Phases of a Test:**

  1) set up (e.g. test instantiation)
  2) exercise (do something with the instantiate object)
  3) verify (is the exercise meeting the developers expectations)
  4) teardown (reset test environment, usually handled implicitly by the test code)

Good to test each of these individually within one describe block.
